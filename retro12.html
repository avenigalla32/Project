      <h1>History</h1>

      <p>
        Tinker Hatfield drew from a very different area in designing the Air
        Jordan XII, taking inspiration from the Japanese flag.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AJ XII was clean and simple. The rich leather upper was stitched to
        resemble a rising sun, while faux reptile leather comprised the toe and
        accent overlays. The AJ XII featured the slogan "TWO 3" down the tongue,
        metal lace loops with Jumpman logos, and a pull tab that ran up the
        entire heel that read, "QUALITY INSPIRED BY THE GREATEST PLAYER EVER."
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the first Air Jordan to feature an ultra-responsive Zoom Air
        unit, as well as lateral and medial support panels designed to work
        together to create one of the most durable shoes in the signature
        series. The shoe also had a full-length carbon fiber shank like its
        predecessor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Originally released in five colorways, the AJ XII's offerings included
        the Black/Red that MJ wore during Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals against
        the Utah Jazz, a game that came to be known as "The Flu Game." Michael
        had fallen ill in the middle of the night prior to that game, and his
        appearance was questionable as he lay on a table in the locker room
        right up until game time. But he dragged himself up and onto the court.
        Not only did he play, he created a performance for the ages as he led
        all scorers with 38 points, including a big 3-pointer that put Chicago
        up for good with 25 seconds to play. The shoe he wore during that game
        is known among collectors as "Flu Game XII."
      </p>

      <p>
        Other colors of the AJ XII saw the floor during that season as well.
        Jordan wore the Black/White shoe during 1997 playoffs. With the AJ XII
        on his feet, MJ made his 11th All-Star game, won his ninth NBA scoring
        title, and was named first-team All-NBA and first-team All-Defense. He
        won his fifth NBA title and NBA Finals MVP while wearing the XII.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beginning in 2003, the Air Jordan XII was re-released in several
        additional colors.

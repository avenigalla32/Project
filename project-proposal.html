        Project Proposal
    </h1>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li class="red">What is your website about?</li>
            <dd>I am planning on making a wesite about Jordans. It will show all the Jordan models that have been released as well as the history behind some of the more significant shoes.</dd>
        <br>
        <li class="red">What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</li>
            <dd>The objective of this website will be to inform and educate those interested in Jordans. It will not only show you a the whole range of options available but also show the significance and history behind the iconic shoes.</dd>
        <br>
        <li class="red">Who is your target audience set?</li>
            <dd>My target audience will be amateur shoe collectors, sneakerheads, or just anyone trying to get more educated on Jordans.</dd>
        <br>
        <li class="red">What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</li>
            <dd>I plan on one page showcasing all of the Jordan models that have been released to date with a brief description of the shoes. On the other pages I will dive deeper into the history behind some of the more iconic models and how they might have developed over time. Apart from just the history aspect of the shoes, I want to try to add a section about what colorways are the rarest for the models as well as talking about their street value/history.</dd>
